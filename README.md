pandahub is a data hub for pandapower and pandapipes networks based on MongoDB. It allows you to store pandapower and
pandapipes networks as well as timeseries in a MongoDB. pandahub allows you to access the database directly through the PandaHub class,
but also provides a REST-API based on FastAPI. Access through the API is managed with a user management implementation based on FastAPI Users.

## Development
`docker compose up -d` runs a mongodb container alongside a pandahub api instance with live reload available
at http://localhost:8002. To connect to an existing database instead, set `MONGODB_URL` to the connection string through an environment variable / in you `.env` file.

Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:8002/docs.

If you develop on the library and do not need the fastapi app, `docker compose up db -d` starts only the mongodb
container.

## MongoClient handling

You can supply a mongodb connection string (or the host as connection string and user/password separately) either as arguments to PandaHub
or by setting the following environment variables:

* MONGODB_URL
* MONGODB_USER (optional)
* MONGODB_PASSWORD (optional)

These values are then used as default arguments when creating a PandaHub object.

By default, each instantiation of a PandaHub instance will create a new MongoClient instance. This is fine for interactive use or small scripts. To clean up the mongo client, call `ph.close()` on the instance once you are done with it.

When running the pandahub API as a web application, provide database credentials through the environment variables and additionally set `PANDAHUB_GLOBAL_DB_CLIENT` to `true`.
A single, global mongodb client instance per process will then be used for all PandaHub instantiations, as recommended by [pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#how-does-connection-pooling-work-in-pymongo).

You can use the following properties to access database resources from a PandaHub object:

* *ph.project_db*: database of the activated project (e.g. `ph.project_db.net_bus.find().to_list()`)
* *ph.mgmt_db*: the user_management database
* *ph.users_collection*: the users collection from the management database
* *ph.projects_collection*: the projects collection from the management database


In case you want to access the database but do not need a PandaHub object, there are two convenience functions available:

```python
from pandahub.lib import get_mongo_client

my_collection = get_mongo_client("db", "collection")
docs = collection.find().to_list()
```
`PANDAHUB_GLOBAL_DB_CLIENT` is respected, you either get the global client or a fresh instance, in which case you are responsible for cleaning up the connection.

```python
from pandahub.lib import mongo_client

with mongo_client("db", "my_collection") as collection:
    docs = collection.find().to_list()
```
With the context manager, a new MongoClient is created (even if `PANDAHUB_GLOBAL_DB_CLIENT` is `true`) and closed on completion of the with block.
